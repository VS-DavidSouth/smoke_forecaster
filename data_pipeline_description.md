### BlueSky smoke concentrations

- BlueSky smoke concentrations are downloaded with: /support_r_scripts/daily_bluesky_download.R
- Using sys.Date, the script checks to see what the most recent output file is, choosing between 00Z and 12Z forecast. Right now only the GFS-0.15deg field is acquired. The smoke dispersion file downloaded is from the "combined" directory, meaning the forecast includes forecast emissions and leftover from the previous period.
